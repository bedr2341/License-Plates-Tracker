# License-Plates-Tracker
With the influx of people coming to Arizona, I noticed a large increase in the variety of license plates. So I wanted to keep track of how many different state license plate I have seen, with hopes of getting all 50! This site helps me with that :)

The D3.js USA map code is an edited version from  [michellechandra's wonderful code](https://gist.github.com/michellechandra/0b2ce4923dc9b5809922#file-cities-lived-csv) for the list of states he's visited.
